      <p>In addressing the persisting challenges surrounding surveillance capitalism, we find ourselves confronted with an array of emerging threats in the era of generative AI. How can visual communication design effectively intervene and navigate these complexities in a meaningful way?</p>
        <p><i>Project A0AI</i> is a multi-modal project consisting of prints, videos, and a performance — exploring the intricate relationship between technology and individuals through an open-ended, experimental, and process-driven design practice. Created through a text-to-image AI tool, the portrait images visually communicates the dehumanizing impact of perceiving individuals as mere data points, susceptible to exploitation and behavior manipulation by tech corporations. These distorted faces, presented as bitmaps, were transformed into animated video clips for analog video feedback experiments — a poignant metaphor for the closed-circuit systems inherent in generative AI technology. This video technique led to the pivotal decision in the design process to embrace the unpredictability and uncertainty both as an attitude and an aesthetic. Furthermore, the intentional use of analog equipment serves as a symbolic act of resistance amidst the rapid advancements of technology. Finally, the live VJ-ing performance is representative of the performative design principles. This dynamic approach allows for active engagement with visual materials, fostering spontaneity in the design process. Beyond its aesthetic value, live VJ-ing creates a visceral and immersive experience, inviting the audience to participate and connect through captivating visuals and music.</p>
       <p>Today, where novel technologies pose threats to fundamental human rights; individual and collective identity; and the essence of human authenticity; visual communication design emerges as a powerful intervention tool. To meaningfully contribute to the discourse on social change, <i>Project A0AI</i> serves to advocate for courageous exploration, radical experimentation, and a commitment to authenticity.</p>
